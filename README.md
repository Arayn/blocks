* Placing and breaking blocks
* Transparent blocks
* Particles
* 65 536 block positions (working on usage!)
* Epic secret features included
* Turn itself on
* Nearest/Linear filtering
* Loading and saving world (we hope)
* Infinite world
* Sometimes it can shut down on it's own
* Loading and saving all settings
* Console
* Fake Ambient Occlusion (blocks shading)
