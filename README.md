Order of the stone
==================
Order of the stone is a voxel game that we make, nothing spectacular...

What can it do
--------------
* Splitting world to chunks
* World generating using simplex noise
* Clever rendering
* Detection of selected block
* Using vertex arrays for chunk rendering
* Blocks with different textures (texture atlas)
* Placing and breaking blocks
* Transparent blocks
* Particles
* 65 536 block positions (working on usage!)
* Epic secret features included
* Turn itself on (with a little bit of help from [launcher](https://github.com/dax105/launcher))
* Nearest/Linear filtering
* Loading and saving world (we hope)
* Infinite world
* Sometimes it can shut down on it's own
* Loading and saving all settings
* Console
* Fake Ambient Occlusion (blocks shading)
* Explosions!
* Survival (HP)
* Sounds and background music
* Basic physics
* Font managing (we are using Roboto font by Google)
* [Authentification](https://github.com/dax105/blocks/wiki/Auth-system) (our/default implementation: [Register](http://ondryasondra.aspone.cz/Register.html))
* AABB Collisions
* Saving custom data for blocks
* Really nice profiler!
