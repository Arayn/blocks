Order of the stone
==================
Order of the stone is a voxel game that I make, nothing spectacular...

What can it do
--------------
> Splitting world to chunks
> World generating using simplex noise
> Clever rendering
> Detection of selected block
> Using vertex arrays for chunk rendering
> Blocks with different textures (texture atlas)
> Placing and breaking blocks
> Transparent blocks
> Particles
> 65 536 block positions (working on usage!)
> Epic secret features included
> Turn itself on
> Nearest/Linear filtering
> Loading and saving world (we hope)
> Infinite world
> Loading and saving all settings
> Console
>	Explosions!
